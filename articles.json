During a news conference in Ottawa today, Trudeau said the federal government is \"pulling out all the stops\" to help Canadians through the global health crisis. \"I want all premiers and Canadians to know your government is here for you,\" Trudeau said. \"We want to ensure that workers are supported,\" she said.
